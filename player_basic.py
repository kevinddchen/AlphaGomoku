    '''Move according to basic features.
    
        'get_features()' returns a [size, size, 8]-shape array containing 9 features for each position of the board:
            0: Number of 2-chains the move will create.
            1: "       " 3-chains "                  ".
            2: "       " 4-chains "                  ".
            3: "       " 5-chains "                  ".
            4: Number of opponent 2-chains the move will block.
            5: "                " 3-chains "                 ".

        The 'w' vector assigns points to each feature, and adds them up. Player makes move with maximum points.
    
    Parameters/Variables ===========
    
        name <string> ... Name of player.
        piece <int> ... Either +1 for black or -1 for white.
        w <array> ... Points assigned to each feature. Defaults to pre-assigned points.
        
    Methods ============
    
        play(game) ... Given Gomoku game, returns move (x, y) to play.
    
        get_features(board, piece) ... Given board and player piece, returns array of features described above.
